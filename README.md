 A 1/43 direct drive slot car chassis designed to be 3D printed
Parts List

 Mabuchi ft-010sa-09190 (28k rpm @ 12V)
 Mabuchi ft-010sa-07300 (21k rpm @ 12V)

Usage
Chassis supports:
- SCX Compact
- Artin 1/43*
- Radio Shack 1/43*
* these body shells will require modification to fit the rear motor as they have pieces that drop from the roof of the car to the rear axle and the motor is slightly too wide to fit in between them.

Print Notes
- Print at 100% infill and as high of quality as you can (0.12 on my ender 3)

To change which mounts are used edit the variables in chassis.scad using OpenScad and export. in addition you can edit the wheelbaseBias variable as desired to adjust the front axle mounts forward (+) and back (-). You can also edit the motorBoxBias variable to move the motor box left (+) or right (-) to account for uneven shaft lengths.

Wheels: Thin wheels are recommended for most applications, wide wheels are recommended for scx and radio shack bodies which have wider bodies.
